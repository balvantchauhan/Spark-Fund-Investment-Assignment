Â£ Project Brief
You work for Spark Funds, an asset management company. Spark Funds wants to make investments in a few companies. The CEO of Spark Funds wants to understand the global trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.

## Business and Data Understanding
  Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:

* It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment
* It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in
* For your analysis, consider a country to be English speaking only if English is one of the official languages in that country
